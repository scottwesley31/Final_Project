### Machine Learning Model (Triangle)

* Unsupervised Machine Learning: 

#### Questionable..?

* Supervised Machine Learning:

#### We would like to run some machine learning models with the cleaned data, once available, that’s when we will get a starting point for how well the model will perform. 
#### We know that there will likely be additional steps to the cleaning process, but this will give us a baseline to see how our additional changes are affecting the models. 
#### To start, we’re thinking M. Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
#### LabelEncoder so all values in columns are numeric.
#### Next, we can define our target variable and features, split and scale the data and build the multiple linear regression model
#### Most likely M.Liner Regression won’t be our best model, once we get outcomes from our R squared.
#### Next, we can try a Random Forest Regressor model with 100 estimators to see if that performs any better before further cleaning the data. Random Forest is better at predicting non-linear data by using decision trees to better fit the model. It might also be better for handling outliers in the data.
#### We can also try using the OneHotEncoder instead of LabelEncoder
#### We will probably be using PyCaret, an open-source machine learning library to help automate the entire process of training a machine learning model. From model selection to training and testing.



### Use of Technologies and Front-End (X)
